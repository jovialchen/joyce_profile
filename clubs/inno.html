    <h2>About the Club</h2>
    <p>
      Our innovation team is a vibrant, employee-driven initiative within the company, dedicated to fostering a culture of creativity and ingenuity. We operate outside of regular work hours, with members contributing their time and expertise to drive innovation. We achieve this through a variety of initiatives, including hosting workshops on patent writing, organizing the annual 'Golden Idea' competition, and publishing our yearly technical journal. These activities provide a platform for members to explore their innovative potential and contribute to the advancement of knowledge, all while building professional development.

    <h2>My Contributions</h2>
    <p>
        During my involvement with the team from 2013 to 2018, I played a pivotal role in the production of our technical journal, contributing my efforts outside of regular work hours. My responsibilities encompassed the entire publication process, including:

        <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Soliciting submissions</strong></li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Creating LaTeX templates</strong></li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Providing video tutorials for template usage</strong></li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Coordinating with designers for cover art</strong></li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Managing the peer-review process</strong></li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Overseeing typesetting, printing, and digital distribution</strong></li>
        </ul>

        In 2013, I served as the primary formatting editor, and from 2014 to 2018, I took on end-to-end responsibility for the journal's production.
