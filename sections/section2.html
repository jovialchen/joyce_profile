    <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<div class="intro" id="book-highlight">
  <p>I'm a storyteller at heart and an engineer by tradeâ€”a curious blend of magic and machine. </p>
  <p>As a child, I was completely fascinated by the wizarding world of <em>Harry Potter</em>. The idea of portraits that could capture the thoughts and experiences of real people was amazing to me. I often wondered what it would be like to talk to historical figures, especially scientists.</p>

  <p>In university, I discovered <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>. Marvin, the paranoid android, quickly became one of my favorite characters. The idea of having a companion that could think deeply and feel complex emotions really captured my imagination.</p>

  <p>When I started my career as a telecommunications engineer, I never thought I would work on artificial intelligence. However, during my maternity leave, I decided to learn about machine learning and deep learning. As I explored these technologies, I realized that I could finally make some of the ideas that had captured my imagination come true.</p>

  <p>Now, as I work on large language models, I feel a deep sense of fulfillment. I'm excited to be part of a field that has the potential to change the way we live and work. My hope is to help develop AI systems that can truly benefit people.</p>
