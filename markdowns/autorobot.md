## My Contributions

*   Designed and implemented a database schema to support Robot Framework test script generation from natural language input.
*   Implemented a multi-agent system leveraging the MetaGPT framework for intelligent test script generation.
*   Developed an interactive user interface using Streamlit.


## Project Overview

*   **Project Goal:** To generate Robot Framework test scripts for communication products, enabling automated testing.
*   **Project Overview:**
    *   The autoRobot project aims to simplify and accelerate the generation of automated test scripts for communication products through natural language processing and a multi-agent system.
    *   The project utilizes the following technologies and methodologies:
        *   **Natural Language to Script Mapping:**  Established a database mapping natural language to corresponding Robot Framework scripts. When a user submits a test requirement, the system matches the corresponding natural language and provides its associated script to a Large Language Model (LLM) for complete test script generation.
        *   **Multi-Agent System:** Constructed a multi-agent system leveraging the MetaGPT framework, which automatically executes script interfaces, enabling more intelligent test script generation and execution.
        *   **User Interface:** Developed an interactive user interface using Streamlit, allowing users to easily input test requirements and view the generated test scripts.
