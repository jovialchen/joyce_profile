# Nokia Bangalore Coding Grand Prix - Machine Learning Lap Competition Experience

**Time:** Nov 2021

There were two tracks in this machine learning competition. Combining the performance across both tracks, I achieved **first place** among 75 participants in this competition with a **total score of 165 points**.  

All model training was conducted in an **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080** GPU environment.

### Track 1: Customer Gift Card Amount Prediction (Regression Task)

The core task of this track was to build a **regression model** to predict the gift card amount a customer might receive.  For this problem, I employed the **XGBoost algorithm**. Through meticulous feature engineering and parameter tuning, the model achieved a score of **71/100** on the test set.

*   **Technical Highlights:** Regression Analysis, XGBoost, Feature Engineering, Parameter Tuning

### Track 2: Diversity & Inclusion Topic Identification (Text Classification Task)

The second track focused on **text classification**, with the objective of determining whether a given text paragraph was related to the "Diversity & Inclusion" topic. I chose to use the **BERT model** combined with a **fully connected layer** to build the classifier.  Benefiting from the BERT model's powerful semantic understanding capabilities, the model attained a score of **94/100** in this track.

*   **Technical Highlights:** Text Classification, BERT, Fully Connected Layer, Deep Learning
