# Feature Readout Tool

## My Contribution

Leading the development of the AI/ML components within the Feature Readout Tool, with initial proposal and implementation of BERT model.
*   **Model Evolution (Initiated with BERT):** I initially proposed and implemented the BERT model for feature relatedness analysis.  Building upon this foundation, I spearheaded the transition to a more advanced LLM RAG approach, significantly enhancing accuracy and depth of understanding. 
*   **Data Labeling:** Set up and deployed the open-source annotation tool Doccano, optimizing the data labeling process and providing strong support for the improvement of AI/ML models.

## Overview

The Feature Readout Tool is a web application designed to centrally display feature-related information. Key functionalities include:

*   **Data Integration:** Extracts feature-related content from databases, such as code Function area, UT coverage, number of test cases, documentation links, etc.
*   **Knowledge Graph:** Utilizes a Neo4j database to dynamically display the relationships between features and bugs in the form of a knowledge graph.
*   **Feature Relatedness Analysis:** Intelligently analyzes the relatedness between features based on two methods: code overlap and NLP (analyzing feature descriptions).

## Benefits

The Feature Readout Tool provides significant benefits across various stages of the software development lifecycle:

The Feature Readout Tool delivers significant advantages across the software development lifecycle:
